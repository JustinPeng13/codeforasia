# Wong Man Kit Challenge 1
I used Django to build this website. I am not sure about if I have to use MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS.

Email: `mkwongjack@gamil.com`
Mobile: `(+852) 63524420 `

## How to run the Website
1. run `python manage.py runserver` on cmd.
2. go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
3. go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin` for admin page.
> Username = `admin` Password = `weboascx`

## About the Page
- `Home`: Go to the Homepage
- `Login`: Login and fill up the forms
- `Logout`: Logout and go back to the Homepage
- `Register`: Signup as a new user

## About the Admin Page
- `Main`: Show the data collected from users
- `User`: List all the users

## Limitation
- No dynamic addresses: the paths are all hard-coded
- Limited styling
- The database design can be more complex
